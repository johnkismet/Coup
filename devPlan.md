--------------------GAMEPLAY--------------------
Offline or online?

If online, we will need to learn how to make multiplayer games.

If offline, the game will have to take a slower pace where only one user can use the computer at a time. Influence will have to be shown to the player on a turn-based system and you must tell everyone else to look away.

1. There are 15 cards in the deck total, 5 unique total, 3 of each type of influence.
2. Each player starts the game with 2 coins and 2 influnece (randomly selected)
3. No matter what influence the user has, they can safely do 5 moves:
    - Take one coin from the bank
    - Receive 2 coins from the bank (foreign aid)
    - Coup
    - Challenge
    - Skip turn
 4. When it is not a users turn they may "Challenge" the active player. They lose the opportunity to challenge when the next player makes their move. (i.e. suppose there are 3 players in this simple example. Player A is the active player, Player B is the next player, and Player 3 would go after Player B. If Player A bluffs on his turn, Player B or C's challenge window is open until Player B begins to make their move (so they can still challenge if it's Player B's turn but Player B hasn't actually made a move))
 5. If the user has 7 coins they are now allowed to "Coup". A coup costs 7 coins, and will unconditionally eliminate one of the other users influence. 
 6. If the user has 10 coins their next move can only be a coup.
 7. If a user is coup'd, assassinated, or inquired they will be forced to choose from their remaining influence which card to reveal. The
 8. Challenging.
    - Positive Challenge: The Challengee will be forced to reveal one of their cards.
    - False Challenge: The challenger will be forced to reveal one of their cards. The challengee must give up the revealed card and shuffle it back into the deck, then acquire a new influence card.
